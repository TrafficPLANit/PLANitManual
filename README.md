# PLANitManual

- We use the entire repo's master branch for github pages (not just the docs dir) because
the repo only contains the manual's statically generated HTML and nothing else 
- The contents of the website are available in PLANitHugo, where this repository is available as a submodule (see PLANitHugo for more information)
	
# Manual Website

The actual website for PLANit is accessible on https://trafficplanit.github.io/PLANitManual/
